      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment
        paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together the soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic and ginger in a medium
        bowl until just combined. Set aside. Combine the rice, tofu and
        vegetables in a large bowl. Add the sauce and gently fold together with

        Spread the mixture on the prepared baking sheet and cover with aluminum
